# ðŸš€ Government of British Columbia Bootstrap v5 Theme

[Demonstrations of the theme](https://anjanak13.github.io/bootstrap-theme/dist/index.html)

A Bootstrap version 5.3 BC Government look-and-feel featuring:

- The [BC Sans](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/bc-visual-identity/bc-sans) typeface
- Compatibility with pure Bootstrap markup

The project is a successor to the previous
[Gov-4.0-Bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/bcgov/bootstrap-theme)
[Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton](https://github.com/bcgov/Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton)
and [mygovbc-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/bcgov/mygovbc-bootstrap-theme).
We combined the best of all projects and leverage the latest
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) version.

## For New Developers

If you find yourself wanting to use the theme in your project outright, you can use the minified CSS file as you would like. You can find the minified CSS file to link to your own project via this [path](dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css):

`dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css`

To ensure certain functions such as dropdowns, tooltips as well as popovers  work you will also have to import the minified JS file onto your project. You can find the minified JS file to link to your own project via this [path](dist/js/bootstrap-theme.min.js):

`dist/js/bootstrap-theme.min.js`

You can add the refernces to external style sheet as well as the JS file inside `<link>` and `<script>` tags within the head section.

- It it worth noting that your path may be different depending on your project strcuture 

```html
<head>
...
    <script defer="defer" src="js/bootstrap-theme.min.js"></script>
    <link href="css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
```
