# ðŸš€ Government of British Columbia Bootstrap v5 Theme

[Demonstrations of the theme](https://anjanak13.github.io/bootstrap-theme/dist/index.html)

A Bootstrap version 5.3 BC Government look-and-feel featuring:

- The [BC Sans](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/bc-visual-identity/bc-sans) typeface
- Compatibility with pure Bootstrap markup

The project is a successor to the previous
[Gov-4.0-Bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/bcgov/bootstrap-theme)
[Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton](https://github.com/bcgov/Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton)
and [mygovbc-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/bcgov/mygovbc-bootstrap-theme).
We combined the best of all projects and leverage the latest
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) version.

## Usage

- ### Direct Integration with Minified Files

    You can directly use the minified CSS and JS files in your project. The minified CSS file to link can be found via this [path](dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css):

    `dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css`

    To ensure dropdowns, tooltips, and popovers function properly, you can import the minified JS file into your project. which can be found via this [path](dist/js/bootstrap-theme.min.js):

    `dist/js/bootstrap-theme.min.js`

    These files can be added to your project's `<head>` section:

    ```html
    <head>
    ...
        <script defer="defer" src="js/bootstrap-theme.min.js"></script>
        <link href="css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    ```
